1. Performs all CRUD operations.
	Sort of, CR work
1. Uses Angular Routing.
	Yes, it does

I created an account on Parse and attempted to follow guides from the lecture notes and other examples.

I ran into trouble with the show page and the routing within Angular, although I don't know if that has anything to do with Parse or just Angular.
