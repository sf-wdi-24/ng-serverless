You're required to build an Angular app and host it on a site other than Heroku.

In addition to not being hosted on Heroku, your project must:

1. Performs all CRUD operations.
1. Uses Angular Routing.

Your pull request must include a description of the process you used to host your app.

Your pull request must include a description of issues you ran into while hosting your app.

**Getting Started**
* Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.

**Submission**
* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
* Your pull request **must** include a link to your working project on a site other than Heroku.
