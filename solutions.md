The app appears to be hosted on Dropbox, but its not fully working.  I'm a bit confused by the Dropbox docs.  I have created a Dropbox app, but its not entirely clear how to deploy it.  And if it should be an App folder or Public folder.

Current error is "Dropbox.client is not a function"

I hope to revisit this soon, but for now I need to start a CRUD app from scratch because I'm not comfortable with that yet.  Heading over to the tutorials...

Ideally, I'll build a basic Angular CRUD app and then host it on Parse or Dropbox.
